        This class represents a CNN block which projects
        `in_channels' to a usually higher amount of channels

        with a kernel of size `kernel_size'. In order to keep
        the resolution of the image the same, it must be padded
        by with `kernel_size//2' zeroes around the image. 

        The image is then pooled with a MaxPool2d operation of size
        `pool_size`, the resulting is a model that has input of shape

        Basic CNN that performs segmentation. This model takes
        an image of shape (batch, in_channels, width, height)
        and outputs an image of shape 
        (batch, out_channels, width//prod(pool_sizes), height//prod(pool_sizes)),
        where prod() is the product of all the values in pool_sizes.

        This is done by using len(pool_sizes) Encoder layers, each of which
        pools the resolution down by a factor of pool_sizes[i].

        The first encoder must project the in_channels to embedding_size.
        Each subsequent layer must double the number of channels in its input,
        for example, the second layer must go from embedding_size to 2*embedding_size,
        the third layer from 2*embedding_size to 4*embedding_size and so on, until
        the pool_sizes list has been depleted.

        The final layer (decoder) must project the (2**len(pool_sizes))*embedding_size 
        channels to output_channels channels. In order to keep the resolution, you 
        may use a 1x1 kernel.

        Hint: If you use a regular list to save your Encoders, these
        will not register with the pytorch module and will not
        have their parameters added to the optimizer. Use nn.ModuleList to avoid this.

        Note: **kwargs is used to capture any additional arguments that are not
        explicitly defined in the function signature. This is so that we can
        construct the object from the same dictionary--certain models don't have addiitonal
        parameters.
